# Weedle's Cave

Weedle's Cave is a kaggle competition that can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/terminus7/pokemon-challenge. 

The goal is to predict the outcome of a pokemon battle given the 2 pokemon. Our training set has the history of previous pokemon battles and who was the victor. In addition, there's a csv provided with the stats of every pokemon.

My childhood domain knowledge may come in handy for this dataset so let's predict them all! (Cringy I know)
